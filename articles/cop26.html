          Climate pledges tough to secure before COP26 summit, PM warns
        </h1>
        <img src="../assets/images/cop26.jpeg" />
        <h2 class="subtitle">
          There is a "six out of 10" chance of getting other countries to sign
          up to financial and environmental targets ahead of November's key
          COP26 climate change conference, the UK PM has said.
        </h2>
        <article class="content">
          Boris Johnson is in the US for a UN meeting where he will urge leaders
          to take "concrete action" on the issue.
          <br />
          <br />
          But he said it would be "tough" to persuade allies to meet their
          promise to give $100bn a year to developing nations to cut carbon
          emissions.
          <br />
          <br />
          The UK is hosting COP26 in Glasgow.
          <br />
          <br />
          With some 100 world leaders expected in New York at the UN General
          Assembly this week, Mr Johnson will seek to galvanise action during a
          series of high-level meetings.
          <br />
          <br />
          Speaking during his flight Mr Johnson told reporters: "I think getting
          it all done this week is going to be a stretch. But I think getting it
          all done by COP, six out of 10.
          <br />
          <br />
          "It's going to be tough but people need to understand that this is
          crucial for the world."
          <br />
          <br />
          Downing Street has said developed countries have "collectively failed"
          on their $100bn (£73bn) target, with OECD figures last week showing
          that only $79.6bn in climate finance was mobilised in 2019 .
          <br />
          <br />

          <br />
          <br />
          COP26 president Alok Sharma, who is with the PM, earlier revealed that
          Chinese President Xi Jinping has not yet committed to attending the
          conference.
          <br />
          <br />
          Mr Johnson said Mr Sharma had had "some great conversations already
          with his Chinese counterparts about the things they want to do".
          <br />
          <br />
          "I think China is massively important to this and I think China shows
          real signs of making progress," he added.
          <br />
          <br />
          Mr Johnson also insisted new International Development Secretary
          Anne-Marie Trevelyan would do an "outstanding job" after social media
          posts emerged showing her previously denying climate change.
          <br />
          <br />
          "I don't want to encourage you but if you were to excavate some of my
          articles from 20 years ago you might find some comments I made...
          about climate change that weren't entirely supportive of the current
          struggle," he said.
          <br />
          <br />
          "But the facts change and people change their minds and change their
          views."
          <br />
          <br />
          Mr Johnson will also travel to Washington where he will meet US
          President Joe Biden in the White House for the first time.
          <br />
          <br />
          The prime minister is likely to push for a restoration of UK-US
          travel, with Mr Biden's administration having maintained a ban despite
          travel restrictions being eased elsewhere.

          Emmy Awards 2021: The Crown and Ted Lasso sweep major categories
        </h1>
        <img src="../assets/images/emmy_2021.jpeg" />
        <h2 class="subtitle">
          Netflix's royal drama The Crown and Apple comedy Ted Lasso were the
          big winners at Sunday's Emmy Awards.
        </h2>
        <article class="content">
          The Crown's prizes included best drama series, plus four acting wins
          for Gillian Anderson, Olivia Colman, Josh O'Connor and Tobias Menzies.
          <br />
          <br />
          "What a lovely end to the most extraordinary journey with this lovely
          family," Colman said of her final series playing Queen Elizabeth II.
          <br />
          <br />
          "I loved every second of it and I can't wait to see what happens
          next."
          <br />
          <br />
          Becoming emotional, she added: "I wish my dad was here to see this. I
          lost my daddy during Covid, and he would've loved all of this."
          <br />
          <br />
          The Crown's victory in the best drama series category is not the first
          time a streaming service has won the top prize at the Emmys but it
          does mark the first victory for Netflix.
          <br />
          <br />
          The 73rd Emmy Awards took place in Los Angeles on Sunday and saw most
          nominees attend in person, although many British nominees appeared
          from a separate Emmys hub in London.
          <br />
          <br />
          Other UK winners included Michaela Coel, who won best limited series
          writing for her sexual consent drama I May Destroy You. "I dedicate
          this story to every single survivor of sexual assault," she said as
          she collected her award.
          <br />
          <br />
          Coel also used her speech to address aspiring writers, telling them:
          "Write the tale that scares you, that makes you feel uncertain, that
          isn't comfortable, I dare you."
          <br />
          <br />
          She said staying away from social media could help them create their
          best work. "Do not be afraid to disappear, from it, from us, for a
          while, and see what comes to you in the silence," she said.
          <br />
          <br />
          Kate Winslet and Ewan McGregor were named best limited series actress
          and actor for Mare of Easttown and Halston respectively.
          <br />
          <br />
          Winslet said: "I want to acknowledge my fellow nominees in this decade
          that has to be about women having each other's backs. I support you, I
          salute you, I am proud of all of you.
          <br />
          <br />
          The HBO crime drama saw the actress play a police detective who is
          investigating the murder of a young girl in a working-class community
          in Pennsylvania.
          <br />
          <br />
          "Mare of Easttown was this cultural moment, and it brought people
          together and gave people something to talk about other than a
          pandemic, and I want to thank everybody for watching our show,"
          Winslet said.
          <br />
          <br />
          Paying tribute to writer and creator Brad Ingelsby, she added: "You
          created a middle-aged, imperfect, flawed mother, and you made us all
          feel validated."
          <br />
          <br />
          Her Mare of Easttown co-stars Evan Peters and Julianne Nicholson also
          both won supporting actor and actress for their performances in the
          show.
          <br />
          <br />
          Jason Sudeikis was named best lead comedy actor for his performance in
          Ted Lasso, while his British co-stars, Hannah Waddingham and Brett
          Goldstein, won best supporting actress and actor.
          <br />
          <br />
          "This show is about family, it's about mentors and teachers, it's
          about teammates," Sudeikis said. "And I wouldn't be here without those
          three things in my life."
          <br />
          <br />
          A successful theatre actress, Waddingham called for more stage stars
          to be given TV roles during her acceptance speech.
          <br />
          <br />
          "West End musical performers need to be on screen more," she told the
          audience. "Please give us a chance because we won't let you down."
          <br />
          <br />
          Ted Lasso, which first aired on Apple TV last year, tells the story of
          a US football coach who moves to the UK to coach a fictional
          Premiership team.
          <br />
          <br />
          Jean Smart was named best lead actress in a comedy series for her
          performance in Hacks.
          <br />
          <br />
          Gillian Anderson was named best drama supporting actress for her
          portrayal of Margaret Thatcher in Netflix series The Crown.
          <br />
          <br />
          "I want to dedicate this award to a woman who was my manager for 20
          years, Connie Freiberg, who believed in me when no-one else would, and
          believed I had talent when I didn't think I had talent," Anderson
          said.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Crown's creator Peter Morgan won outstanding drama writing, while
          Jessica Hobbs won best drama directing.
          <br />
          <br />
          Morgan said: "I'm very proud, I'm very grateful, we're going to party.
          Goodnight."
          <br />
          <br />
          Hobbs thanked other female directors and her mother, who she said is
          still directing at the age of 77. Menzies was not present to collect
          his award.
          <br />
          <br />
          The ceremony, hosted by US comedian Cedric the Entertainer, was held
          after a year of increased TV viewing prompted by lockdown restrictions
          around the world.

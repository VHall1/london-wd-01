          Jimmy Greaves: Spurs, Chelsea and West Ham lead tributes to former
          striker
        </h1>
        <img src="../assets/images/jimmy_greaves.jpeg" />
        <h2 class="subtitle">
          Tottenham and Chelsea led the tributes for their former player Jimmy
          Greaves, who has died aged 81.
        </h2>
        <article class="content">
          A host of Spurs legends lined the pitch inside the Tottenham Hotspur
          Stadium as a minute's applause was held before kick-off.
          <br />
          <br />
          Martin Chivers, Steve Perryman, Micky Hazard, Paul Allen, Ossie
          Ardiles, Gary Mabbutt, Graham Roberts, Glenn Hoddle, Ledley King and
          Michael Dawson were all present.
          <br />
          <br />
          During the applause, some Spurs fans held flags and banners to
          remember the club's record goalscorer.
          <br />
          <br />
          Former Spurs and England striker Gary Lineker told BBC Sport: "Jimmy
          had a fabulous contribution to football, an incredible goalscoring
          record.
          <br />
          <br />
          "He was devilishly funny as well with his wit and personality, so
          charismatic. But on the field of play people will remember him most.
          Those of us that are old enough to have witnessed his magnificence at
          times, he could score all sorts of goals and was a beautifully
          graceful footballer and a wonderful finisher.
          <br />
          <br />
          "For me, Jimmy was one of my heroes as well. Growing up watching him
          play we didn't have the amount of games on television that we now do
          but I managed to see him play a few times.
          <br />
          <br />
          "I also was fortunate enough to meet him on numerous occasions and he
          was always affable and fun and hugely knowledgeable. He was a great
          personality, a wonderful footballer and a man with huge charisma and
          fun and he will be much missed."
          <br />
          <br />
          On an emotional day across football grounds, West Ham, another of
          Greaves' former clubs, also held a minute's applause before their
          Premier League match against Manchester United, as did Brighton and
          Leicester City.
          <br />
          <br />
          Players from all six teams wore black armbands for Greaves, who holds
          the record for most goals in the English top flight with 357.
          <br />
          <br />
          Spurs captain Harry Kane, who is second behind Greaves on the club's
          scoring list, told Sky Sports before facing Chelsea: "First and
          foremost our condolences to Jimmy's family and close friends. It's a
          sad one but hopefully a day we can celebrate.
          <br />
          <br />
          "He played for Tottenham and Chelsea and hopefully we put in a great
          performance in his honour.
          <br />
          <br />
          "Jimmy was an incredible player and goalscorer and a legend for club
          and country.
          <br />
          <br />
          "It's frightening really how good a player he was. For someone like me
          to look at his numbers and one day go on to break those numbers would
          be incredible. I got to meet him back in 2017 and it's just a
          celebration of him today."
          <br />
          <br />
          Greaves began his career with Chelsea and his 41 goals in 1960-61
          remains a record in a season for the Blues.
          <br />
          <br />
          Greaves won two FA Cups and one Cup Winners' Cup and scored 266 goals
          in 379 appearances for Spurs, where he is considered a club legend.

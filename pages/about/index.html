        <article>
          [1] BBC Online, formerly known as BBCi, is the BBC's online service. It is
          a large network of websites including such high-profile sites as BBC
          News and Sport, the on-demand video and radio services co-branded BBC
          iPlayer, the children's sites CBBC and CBeebies, and learning services
          such as Bitesize. The BBC has had an online presence supporting its TV
          and radio programmes and web-only initiatives since April 1994,[1] but
          did not launch officially until 28 April 1997, following government
          approval to fund it by TV licence fee revenue as a service in its own
          right. Throughout its history, the online plans of the BBC have been
          subject to competition and complaint from its commercial rivals, which
          has resulted in various public consultations and government reviews to
          investigate their claims that its large presence and public funding
          distorts the UK market.
